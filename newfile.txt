With stricter emission norms under BS6 Phase 2,
even large SUV buyers are increasingly looking
for petrol-powered options in a bid to avoid a
cumbersome ownership experience. The latest carmaker
to enter the large petrol-powered SUV space is
Tata Motors, which recently launched the Harrier
and Safari petrol SUVs in India. With the Safari
being the 7-seater between the two, many family
car buyers are likely to consider the SUV as it
starts from an attractive price tag of Rs 13.29 lakh
ex-showroom.
